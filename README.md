## Roadmap

### Phase 1: Introduction
- **Goal**: Provide an overview of the Expenses Notebook App and its core features.
  - A brief explanation of the app's purpose (e.g., tracking daily expenses).
  - Highlight main functionalities: adding, editing, deleting expenses, and category management.

### Phase 2: Setting Up the Environment
- **Installing Dependencies**:
  - Install necessary tools and libraries:
    - Node.js for server-side functionality.
    - SQLite for database management.
    - jQuery for client-side interactivity.
    - Basic HTML and CSS for the UI.
- **Creating the Project Structure**:
  - Set up a clear directory structure:

    ```
    project-root/
    ├── backend/
    │   ├── datadb/
    │   │   └── expense.db
    │   └── server.js
    ├── public/
    │   ├── css/
    │   ├── js/
    │   │   ├── app.js
    │   │   ├── category.js
    │   │   ├── update_expense.js
    │   │   └── database.js
    │   ├── categories.html

    ```

### Phase 3: Database Setup
- **Initializing the Database**:
  - Create an SQLite database (`database.sqlite`) using Node.js.
- **Creating Tables**:

    ```sql
    CREATE TABLE categories (
      id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
      name TEXT NOT NULL
    );
    
    CREATE TABLE expenses (
      id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
      description TEXT NOT NULL,
      amount REAL NOT NULL,
      category_id INTEGER,
      date TEXT NOT NULL,
      FOREIGN KEY (category_id) REFERENCES categories (id)
    );
    ```
