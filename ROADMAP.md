# ROADMAP

## Roadmap for Expenses Notebook App using SQLite, jQuery, HTML, and Node.js

This roadmap outlines the development phases for building the Expenses Notebook App, a lightweight tool to manage personal expenses with features like category management, CRUD operations, and a user-friendly interface.

---

### Phase 1: Introduction
- **Goal**: Provide an overview of the Expenses Notebook App and its core features.
  - A brief explanation of the app's purpose (e.g., tracking daily expenses).
  - Highlight main functionalities: adding, editing, deleting expenses, and category management.

---

### Phase 2: Setting Up the Environment
- **Installing Dependencies**:
  - Install necessary tools and libraries:
    - Node.js for server-side functionality.
    - SQLite for database management.
    - jQuery for client-side interactivity.
    - Basic HTML and CSS for the UI.
- **Creating the Project Structure**:
  - Set up a clear directory structure:

    ```
    project-root/
    ├── backend/
    │   ├── datadb/
    │   │   └── expense.db
    │   └── server.js
    ├── public/
    │   ├── css/
    │   ├── js/
    │   │   ├── app.js
    │   │   ├── category.js
    │   │   ├── update_expense.js
    │   │   └── database.js
    │   ├── categories.html
    │   ├── database.html
    │   ├── index.html
    │   └── update_expense.html
    │   
    ├── package.json
    └── README.md

    ```

---

### Phase 3: Database Setup
- **Initializing the Database**:
  - Create an SQLite database (`database.sqlite`) using Node.js.
- **Creating Tables**:
  - Define tables for `categories` and `expenses`:
    ```sql
    CREATE TABLE categories (
      id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
      name TEXT NOT NULL
    );
    
    CREATE TABLE expenses (
      id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
      description TEXT NOT NULL,
      amount REAL NOT NULL,
      category_id INTEGER,
      date TEXT NOT NULL,
      FOREIGN KEY (category_id) REFERENCES categories (id)
    );
    ```
- **Database CRUD Operations**:
  - Implement basic CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) in the server code for both tables.

---

### Phase 4: Building the User Interface
- **Main Application Window**:
  - Develop a simple HTML structure for the app, styled with CSS.
- **Adding Expense Entries**:
  - Include form fields for expense details:
    - Description
    - Amount
    - Category (dropdown menu)
    - Date
- **Displaying Expenses in a Table**:
  - Render a dynamic table using jQuery to display expense data fetched from the database.

---

### Phase 5: Implementing CRUD Operations
- **Adding Expenses**:
  - Create a form submission handler that sends data to the backend via AJAX and updates the table dynamically.
- **Editing Expenses**:
  - Implement an "Edit" button for each row in the table:
    - Open a modal with pre-filled expense details.
    - Submit changes via AJAX to update the database and UI.
- **Deleting Expenses**:
  - Add a "Delete" button for each row:
    - Show a confirmation dialog before removing the record.
    - Update the table dynamically after deletion.

---

### Phase 6: Managing Categories
- **Category Dialog**:
  - Create a modal for adding and editing categories.
- **Linking Categories with Expenses**:
  - Populate the category dropdown in the expense form dynamically.
  - Update the database schema to associate each expense with a category.

---

### Phase 7: Error Handling and Validation
- **Server-Side Validation**:
  - Ensure data integrity with checks for required fields and valid input formats.
- **Client-Side Validation**:
  - Use jQuery to validate form inputs before submission.
- **Error Handling**:
  - Use try-catch blocks in the backend to handle database and server errors.
  - Display user-friendly error messages in the UI.

---

### Phase 8: Final Touches
- **Improving the User Interface**:
  - Add CSS enhancements for a clean, responsive design.
  - Include icons or tooltips for better usability.
- **Testing the Application**:
  - Perform rigorous testing to ensure all features work as expected:
    - Check edge cases for CRUD operations.
    - Validate category linking and data consistency.

---

### Phase 9: Conclusion
- **Summary**:
  - Recap the app’s features and the development process.
  - Highlight key learnings and potential improvements for the future.
- **Future Enhancements**:
  - Suggest ideas like data export, reporting features, or cloud integration.
